### Parkinson Project for DataScience
# Data Science Model
**Parkinson Model**

*In this project, I developed a model under the name of data science and python fundamentals.
The general purpose of my project was to design an educational model with the data on the dataset, and the resulting model is to determine whether the person has Parkinson's disease or not, by making use of the past data.
Let me talk about the dataset I used in my project first.
There are more than 20 attributes in the parkinson data.
These attributes are the frequencies in the brain or the blood pH values. 
Among these attributes, there is only one attribute, the "Status" attribute, which has classification judgment. 
In short, when we create machine learning algorithms and artificial neural network model, we want this "status" attribute to be assigned as the dependent variable and we assign all the remaining attributes as independent variables. 
In my project, I did data preprocessing, data visualization and data analysis using this data set before machine learning algorithms and artificial neural network models. 
Then, as the last step, I created the models I mentioned and observed the accuracy rates.*
